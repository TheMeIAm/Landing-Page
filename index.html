            <p>Young children do not have to go to school 
                to work. Playtime for them is a time of 
                learning by practice. Every new movement 
                which a little child makes is tried first 
                of all tentatively and then repeated until 
                the first clumsiness is gradually refined 
                to an exact movement. Every plaything he 
                uses is a tool for his work.</p>
